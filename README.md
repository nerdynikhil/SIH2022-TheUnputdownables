## Problem Statement
Grade-wise iron-ore accounting from mines to end-points to prevent loss of revenue to the state.

## Description
Due to underestimation and misidentification of the various grades of minerals, the economic development becomes stuck.Varied grades of the same material have different prices, royalty rates, and customs taxes. Producers have been known to misclassify one grade for another to pay a reduced royalty fee for that grade. State governments lose revenue as a result of this. Exporters have also been known to misclassify a grade with a higher export duty as a grade with a lower export charge. To take advantage of export duty differentials, exporters frequently misclassify iron ore (export duty 30%) as iron ore pellet (export duty 5%). The state suffers a revenue loss as a result of this. The state suffers a revenue loss as a result of this. The employment of advanced technology to distinguish between different grades of the same materials (e.g., different grades of iron ore, pellets) will be extremely valuable in preventing system leakages. Furthermore, a smart system that monitors or accounts for the transport/ movement of various grades of minerals from mines to endpoints such as processing units/factories and/or ports will aid in the prevention of leakages. To develop innovative technology to analyze the various levels of mines while also ensuring the tracking of raw minerals from mines to endpoints.
